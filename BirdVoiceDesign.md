Perfect.
Now we design the **bird voices** — this is where your game becomes memorable.

In an audio-first blind game, voice design = character design + UI design + psychological manipulation.

If done well → judges will remember your game.
If flat → birds feel like generic hints.

# 🐦 BIRD VOICE DESIGN

For *Echoes of the Dead*

---

# 🎯 Design Goals

Each bird must:

* ✔ Be instantly recognizable without visual cues
* ✔ Have a unique personality
* ✔ Be distinguishable by tone alone
* ✔ Support gameplay psychology
* ✔ Not overlap in frequency range

Blind players rely heavily on tone patterns.
Your birds must feel like different personalities, not just different sentences.

# 🟢 1️⃣ Truth Bird – “The Calm Guide”

### Personality

* Calm
* Grounded
* Slightly older tone
* Stable breathing

### Vocal Style

* Medium pitch
* Slow pacing
* Confident but not dramatic

### Example Lines

* “Left… medium distance.”
* “Behind you… very close.”
* “Front. Far.”

### Audio Design

* No reverb
* Clean, centered audio
* Slight low-mid warmth

### Psychological Role

This bird becomes the player’s anchor.
Player subconsciously feels safe when hearing it.

---

# 🔴 2️⃣ Inverter Bird – “The Confident Liar”

### Personality

* Bold
* Assertive
* Slightly sharper tone
* Speaks faster

### Vocal Style

* Slightly higher pitch
* Quick delivery
* Clear articulation

### Example Lines

* “Right! Very close!”
* “Front! It’s almost here!”

Even when wrong, it sounds confident.

### Audio Design

* Slight brightness boost
* Very subtle stereo widening

### Psychological Role

This bird causes “Confidently Wrong” moments.

Player thinks:
“That sounded certain.”

And dies.

---

# 🟡 3️⃣ Split Bird – “The Uncertain One”

### Personality

* Hesitant
* Thoughtful
* Slight nervousness

### Vocal Style

* Small pauses
* Slight wavering tone
* Slower start of sentence

### Example Lines

* “Left… I think… close.”
* “Behind you… maybe far?”

Important: Do NOT overdo uncertainty.
Still clear enough to understand.

### Audio Design

* Slight softer volume
* Slight subtle room reverb

### Psychological Role

Creates doubt.
Player hesitates.
Hesitation creates tension.

---

# 🟣 4️⃣ Mimic Bird – “The Trickster”

### Personality

* Neutral baseline
* Slight playful undertone

### Vocal Style

* Medium pitch
* Controlled pacing
* Slight smirk energy

But here’s the trick:

It mimics the logic, NOT the tone.

Do NOT change voice tone every time it mimics.
That would confuse players unfairly.

### Example Lines

* “Right. Very close.”
* “Front… far away.”

Neutral delivery.
No emotional cue.

### Psychological Role

Destroys pattern recognition late game.

---

# 🎧 Audio Frequency Separation (IMPORTANT)

Make sure birds occupy slightly different tonal ranges.

| Bird     | Frequency Feel   |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Truth    | Warm mids        |
| Inverter | Brighter highs   |
| Split    | Softer mids      |
| Mimic    | Balanced neutral |

This prevents blending.

---

# 🎤 Recording Strategy (Efficient Method)

Instead of recording full sentences:

Record modular clips:

### Direction Clips

* “Front”
* “Left”
* “Right”
* “Behind you”

### Urgency Clips

* “Far”
* “Medium distance”
* “Close”
* “Very close”

Then combine dynamically.

Example:

```plaintext
[Direction Clip] + small pause + [Urgency Clip]
```

This reduces workload massively.

---

# ⏱ Timing Design (VERY IMPORTANT)

Add 0.2–0.4 second pause between direction and urgency.

Example:
“Left.” (pause) “Very close.”

That pause increases tension dramatically.

---

# 🎚 Volume Balance Rule

Bird volume must NEVER overpower zombie audio.

Ideal mix:

* Zombie = 100%
* Bird = 85%
* Weapon = 110%
* Heartbeat = 70%

Adjust after testing.

---

# 🧠 Psychological Layer Trick (Advanced)

When zombie is VERY CLOSE:

Bird slightly speeds up speech by 10%.

This subconsciously signals urgency even if words lie.

Players feel pressure without knowing why.

---

# ⚠️ What NOT To Do

❌ Don’t use robotic TTS without emotion
❌ Don’t add heavy reverb
❌ Don’t make birds scream
❌ Don’t overlap birds speaking at once
❌ Don’t use similar voice tone for all

Clarity > Drama.

---

# 🏆 What Judges Will Notice

Blind judges will check:

* Can I identify bird without thinking?
* Does tone help pattern recognition?
* Does it feel immersive?
* Is speech clear and paced properly?
* Is it fatiguing after 5 minutes?

If yes → high accessibility + creativity score.

---

# 🎯 Final Golden Rule

In your game:

Zombies create fear.
Birds create doubt.

Their voices must emotionally reflect that.
